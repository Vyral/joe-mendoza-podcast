        "content": "Akshay Patel is not just a mortgage lender, he’s an undeniable force. Here’s what makes him so special.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report.Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale.I’m so excited to be joined by a special guest today. He’s super unique, super ambitious, and I’m excited to be sharing the stage with him today. His name is Akshay Patel and he is an absolutely fantastic mortgage lender here in San Diego.I recently had a VA buyer who wasn’t able to get him qualified with other lenders. Once they went to Akshay, he was able to get the buyer qualified. Here’s why.One big reason why Akshay is so successful is that he focuses on solutions, not problems. Instead of just saying no or pushing things to the side if there isn’t an easy fix, he works to find solutions to all of our clients’ problems. He’s actually been able to get seven deals done this year that other lenders weren’t able to get done first. Whether it’s a long-term plan or a short-term one, if there’s a solution, Akshay is going to find it.“IF THERE’S A SOLUTION, AKSHAY IS GOING TO FIND IT.”There are no days off for Akshay, and that’s because he’s passionate about getting homebuyers qualified to purchase homes. He’s persistent, he never gives up, and he goes the extra mile for everyone he works with. He wasn’t hustling for our clients just because he was a friend, he was hustling because he is all about his business. He wants to help bring us to the next level, and we want to do the same for him. It’s been a very fruitful partnership thus far.The big banks generally make our clients jump through so many hoops, a lot of times they end up just wanting to give up. I recently had a client who was fed up with the big banks and trying to do a 1031 exchange, so I set him up with Akshay and was able to get a solution figured out in just a quick, 20-minute phone call. Even if clients get turned down by other lenders, Akshay never takes no for an answer.If you’re not sure whether or not that you can qualify to buy a home, you should get in touch with Akshay first. You can give him a call at (858) 207-8436. If you have any other questions about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to working with you soon.",
