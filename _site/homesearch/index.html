He was very diligent and very thorough with explaining things that we were unaware of, but most importantly he was able to prioritize exactly what we wanted so the results were beyond what we expected. We needed an inspection and he was able to be at our place for the inspection for what I believe was a duration of three hours so that right there showed us that he was dedicated to making this experience complete and stress-free for us.</p>

I heard of Joe from some of our friends so he was one of the agents that we interviewed. Eventually, we had him deal with both, the sale of the house and also the purchase of the house I am currently in. I was really upfront with him at the time and I told him exactly what we needed and he was able to come through. I was expecting at least three months of being on the market and we were in fact on the market for about two weeks before we got the first offer. That was pretty good for us!</p>

He does not beat around the bush and he delivers his message very nicely. Heâs been valuable for my mindset and his positive attitude has definitely rubbed off on me. He;s helped me to look at the positives even when I am going through something that is difficult and that has really helped me tackle my business no matter whatâs going on. I am keeping focused, keeping positive, and getting the job done. Iâve already recommended him to several colleagues of mine and I tell them that I canât imagine not having him as a coach for the rest of my career. I feel like weâre a team and he has helped my business tremendously. So, since I have been in coaching with him my business has grown.</p>

Well, we wanted to sell it (the house) quickly, so by the time I contacted him within two days we had the For Sale sign up. Offers started coming in, he listed very quickly. So, he moved very quickly. I would tell people he is very knowledgeable. He;s been in the business over 20 years, over 25 years I believe, but the main thing is he is very trustworthy. Heâs always smiling and laughing so heâs a pleasure to be around as well.</p>

He listened, he understands, he also is a fantastic problem solver. Heâs also very motivating. He always has words of encouragement and can guide you in the right way. Through his coaching, he has given me discipline with a schedule. Heâs made me understand the value of offering an abundance of not only experience and information but customer care. I was previously focused on my education so I had a lot of knowledge about my area of expertise, but I didnât know how to showcase that. So, Joe helped me find my path in marketing and how to network, and how to make phone calls, scripts, what to say, that way it showcased the value in the information that I was providing clients so that I can build that long term rapport. Itâs not a one-on-one transaction. We are building relationships.</p>

I was one of his first clients and he actually sacrificed, maybe I shouldnât say this, because he actually sacrificed some of his commission to ensure that I was happy. I had a termite infested pergola, like a backyard patio, and we didnât catch it during the sale and inspection. And so I complained about it and he actually, to keep me happy as a client, he actually refunded me part of his commission. And at the time it was $500, I thought that was a lot of money at the time and I was one of his first clients. After that incident, I felt bad I took money out of him as one of his first clients, but he kept the customer happy and I alway refer people to him, I said thereâs no other realtors I would go to beyond him. I tell them that heâs honest, fair, heâs smart and he has the experience in a difficult challenging industry and theyâre getting one of the best when they hire him on.</p>
