I’ve known Scott for a few years, and he’s a stand-up guy doing great business. I’m so pleased to have him on “The Real Estate Raw Show” to talk about his career and his tactics.

9:40—Scott’s words of caution to anyone out there teaching about note-buying

11:20—For those just getting started in the business, what is the hardest aspect of the job?

13:00—Different states have different foreclosure time frames, so are some states easier to work in than others?

14:15—Start-up fees and ongoing monthly fees for new arrivals to the field

17:00—A quick break in the discussion and a word from our sponsors

20:33—What kind of numbers are in play in the note-buying game?

25:00—What to say in tough situations involving tenants of the properties

32:00—Scott’s preferences among asset class, storage, apartments, shopping centers, single-family homes

34:25—Is negotiating with the banks difficult?

35:45—Is there a minimum buy-in?

22:19—Vinney’s biggest “why”: What kept him going through the hard times

27:14—How much time Vinny spends finding or raising money versus finding a deal

28:37—Advice for single-family agents about our turning market: Should we be cautious or carefree?

Akshay Patel is not just a mortgage lender, he’s an undeniable force. Here’s what makes him so special.

I’m so excited to be joined by a special guest today. He’s super unique, super ambitious, and I’m excited to be sharing the stage with him today. His name is Akshay Patel and he is an absolutely fantastic mortgage lender here in San Diego.

I recently had a VA buyer who wasn’t able to get him qualified with other lenders. Once they went to Akshay, he was able to get the buyer qualified. Here’s why.

One big reason why Akshay is so successful is that he focuses on solutions, not problems. Instead of just saying no or pushing things to the side if there isn’t an easy fix, he works to find solutions to all of our clients’ problems. He’s actually been able to get seven deals done this year that other lenders weren’t able to get done first. Whether it’s a long-term plan or a short-term one, if there’s a solution, Akshay is going to find it.

“IF THERE’S A SOLUTION, AKSHAY IS GOING TO FIND IT.”

There are no days off for Akshay, and that’s because he’s passionate about getting homebuyers qualified to purchase homes. He’s persistent, he never gives up, and he goes the extra mile for everyone he works with. He wasn’t hustling for our clients just because he was a friend, he was hustling because he is all about his business. He wants to help bring us to the next level, and we want to do the same for him. It’s been a very fruitful partnership thus far.

The big banks generally make our clients jump through so many hoops, a lot of times they end up just wanting to give up. I recently had a client who was fed up with the big banks and trying to do a 1031 exchange, so I set him up with Akshay and was able to get a solution figured out in just a quick, 20-minute phone call. Even if clients get turned down by other lenders, Akshay never takes no for an answer.

If you’re not sure whether or not that you can qualify to buy a home, you should get in touch with Akshay first. You can give him a call at (858) 207-8436. If you have any other questions about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to working with you soon.

Hector Padilla, my guest today is a great friend of mine in the multifamily commercial investing business. Since I met him in 2004, I have watched him accumulate massive amounts of property.

Today I want to share some of his story and discuss how he got from washing dishes to accumulating over $86 million worth of property. I have provided timestamps for you below so that you can jump to whatever topics you like throughout the video above.

• 1:05 - Hectors humble beginnings as a dishwasher.

• 2:20 - The drive to succeed is driven by your circle of influence.

• 4:20 - The value of hiring a coach: exponential growth.

• 7:40 - Think about your ideal lifestyle; how much will it cost you?

• 11:55 - Making lots of money is not the same thing as creating wealth.

• 13:35 - Dont hold yourself back by assuming that you dont need to grow.

• 15:30 - Focus on what youre good at. If real estate isnt your skill, consider partnering with an acquisition firm in a joint venture.

• 17:00 - If you are thinking about making a sudden career change: read Pivot by Adam Markel.

• 18:50 - Details about Hectors free webinar wherein he tells more of his story and how he works with funding partners and private investors to find deals.

• 20:20 - Rude awakenings as motivation.

• 22:00 - Dont give in to the victim mentality. Excuses are not crutches.

• 25:00 - Success in real estate and wealth creation is hard work.

• 26:35 -  If its meant to be, its up to me.

I really appreciate the time Hector took to have this discussion with me and the insight to success that his story provides. If you have any questions about buying, selling, or investing in real estate, you are absolutely encouraged to reach out to us. We can discuss your goals and talk about what we can bring to the table in order to make them happen.
