&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On today’s episode of “The Real Estate Raw Show,” I’m excited to conclude our interview with mega-successful real estate investor Mitch Stephen. As I said before, Mitch has bought, owner-financed, and sold over 1,500 homes in his hometown since 1996, and he has plenty more to say about how he was able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For your convenience, I’ve timestamped the rest of the interview below so that you can jump to whatever topics interest you most:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:15 - The story of how Mitch wrote his first book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:27 - The inspiration behind his message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:14 - A CliffsNotes breakdown of all the books Mitch has published and what they can teach you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15:28 - Books that have changed Mitch’s life and the lessons they taught him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19:30 - His advice to anyone who thinks they’re stuck in a rut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22:30 - How he works with sellers and what the benefits of owner financing are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26:00 - How he automates his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29:30 - Why storage units are such a great investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I want to thank Mitch for being on my show, and I hope he can join us again someday to share more stories about how to achieve and maintain his level of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I’M SUPER EXCITED TO SHARE THE SECOND HALF OF THIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU.%20http://localhost:4000/how-mitch-stephen-became-mega0.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I’M SUPER EXCITED TO SHARE THE SECOND HALF OF THIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another edition of the “Real Estate Raw Show.” Today I have a very special guest, Darrin Brightmon. He’s a former star running back for UNLV, a colonel in the Army Reserves, and a fantastic general contractor with a great company, BDG Builders.

        <title>An Interview With One of the Hardest-Working Lenders Around</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqKwBmP0cdI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akshay Patel is not just a mortgage lender, he’s an undeniable force. Here’s what makes him so special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Want to sell your home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://joemendoza.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy a home? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homesnap.com/Joe-Mendoza&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited to be joined by a special guest today. He’s super unique, super ambitious, and I’m excited to be sharing the stage with him today. &lt;strong&gt;His name is Akshay Patel and he is an absolutely fantastic mortgage lender here in San Diego.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a VA buyer who wasn’t able to get him qualified with other lenders. Once they went to Akshay, he was able to get the buyer qualified. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big reason why Akshay is so successful is that he focuses on solutions, not problems. Instead of just saying no or pushing things to the side if there isn’t an easy fix, he works to find solutions to all of our clients’ problems. He’s actually been able to get seven deals done this year that other lenders weren’t able to get done first. &lt;strong&gt;Whether it’s a long-term plan or a short-term one, if there’s a solution, Akshay is going to find it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=IF THERE’S A SOLUTION, AKSHAY IS GOING TO FIND IT.%20http://localhost:4000/an-interview-with-one-of-hardest.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“IF THERE’S A SOLUTION, AKSHAY IS GOING TO FIND IT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no days off for Akshay, and that’s because he’s passionate about getting homebuyers qualified to purchase homes. He’s persistent, he never gives up, and he goes the extra mile for everyone he works with. He wasn’t hustling for our clients just because he was a friend, he was hustling because he is all about his business. He wants to help bring us to the next level, and we want to do the same for him. It’s been a very fruitful partnership thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big banks generally make our clients jump through so many hoops, &lt;strong&gt;a lot of times they end up just wanting to give up.&lt;/strong&gt; I recently had a client who was fed up with the big banks and trying to do a 1031 exchange, so I set him up with Akshay and was able to get a solution figured out in just a quick, 20-minute phone call. Even if clients get turned down by other lenders, Akshay never takes no for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure whether or not that you can qualify to buy a home, you should get in touch with Akshay first. You can give him a call at (858) 207-8436. If you have any other questions about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to working with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Story of Investing Success</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxHg5ZY7BxY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My special guest, Hector Padilla, is here today to share his story about how he went from washing dishes to being a multimillionaire real estate investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hector Padilla, my guest today is a great friend of mine in the multifamily commercial investing business. Since I met him in 2004, I have watched him accumulate massive amounts of property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to share some of his story and discuss how he got from washing dishes to accumulating over $86 million worth of property. I have provided timestamps for you below so that you can jump to whatever topics you like throughout the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;1:05&lt;/strong&gt; - Hectors humble beginnings as a dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;2:20&lt;/strong&gt; - The drive to succeed is driven by your circle of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;4:20&lt;/strong&gt; - The value of hiring a coach: exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;7:40&lt;/strong&gt; - Think about your ideal lifestyle; how much will it cost you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;11:55&lt;/strong&gt; - Making lots of money is not the same thing as creating wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;13:35&lt;/strong&gt; - Dont hold yourself back by assuming that you dont need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;15:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Focus on what youre good at. If real estate isnt your skill, consider partnering with an acquisition firm in a joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;17:00&lt;/strong&gt; - If you are thinking about making a sudden career change: read Pivot by Adam Markel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;18:50&lt;/strong&gt; - Details about Hectors free webinar wherein he tells more of his story and how he works with funding partners and private investors to find deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;20:20&lt;/strong&gt; - Rude awakenings as motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;22:00&lt;/strong&gt; - Dont give in to the victim mentality. Excuses are not crutches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;25:00&lt;/strong&gt; - Success in real estate and wealth creation is hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;26:35&lt;/strong&gt; -  If its meant to be, its up to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate the time Hector took to have this discussion with me and the insight to success that his story provides. If you have any questions about buying, selling, or investing in real estate, you are absolutely encouraged to reach out to us. We can discuss your goals and talk about what we can bring to the table in order to make them happen.&lt;/p&gt;
