As a coach, I work with clients across a wide range of experience levels. I help educate and inform professionals who are fresh into the industry, those who have a few years under their belt, and even those running brokerages with multi-million dollar net worths. And among my clients, the ones who get the most from my coaching follow five important steps.

Today I would like to give you an overview of what these steps are. If you understand and apply them, yourself, I promise that you will be able to achieve a life by design. Letâ€™s dive right in.

**1. Be prepared for our coaching sessions.** Clients who have done their homework and who arrive on time and with a positive attitude are more likely to see results from our sessions. My schedule is very tight, so cancelling last minute or showing up late are unacceptable. Punctuality is a part of our Tom Ferry coaching policy.<br><br>Also, being prepared means more than just being on time. You should have questions and ideas already in mind before our sessions begin. The quality of our time together will be determined by the quality of the questions you bring to the table.

**2. Engage in at least four events every year.** Specifically, I recommend participating in the Sales Edge training event at least twice a year. Outside of that, there are a number of other events that may match your goals as a professional. Strategic engagement of these training events will do amazing things for your growth in the industry.<br><br>Also, I highly recommend that you attend the Summit, which is a once-a-year event attended by over 5,000 people. Marketing Edge and BluePrint are also great. The issue of distance should be no excuse. There are events all over, and some are even available to watch digitally through a streaming service.

**3. Leverage the Facebook community.** Tom Ferry has a Facebook group for clients of every membership level, so make sure to get the most out of whichever one applies to you. Engaging with these groups could even bring you referrals. While openly advertising is absolutely frowned upon, this has been a result some clients have achieved in the past by simply learning from and participating in the group. These pages are a great place to share ideas, ask questions, and have conversations with your fellow professionals.

**4. Leverage Tom Ferry.** Make sure that you are paying attention to Facebook live meetings, announcements, and training opportunities. These will be very valuable to you.

**5. Leverage the people around you.** There are some very, very valuable people around you. So mastermind, set up roleplay, and use collaboration effectively to foster yourself as successful professional in the Tom Ferry ecosystem. You should be treating the Tom Ferry coaching platform like a gym membership. Just like a gym membership, having a membership with this coaching platform will only bring you results if you put in the effort. The more you put in, the more you will get out.<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}
