Welcome to another edition of “The Real Estate Raw Show.” In our latest installment, we’re featuring another guest I’m delighted to be with and who I’ve known for ages: Imran Clark. As a business partner of mine, I’ve seen his superlative talents as an investor firsthand.&nbsp;

Now, **he’s expanded on his skills by becoming more than an investor—he is a real estate broker and developer as well**; that’s to say nothing of the fact that, before ever cracking into investing, Imran earned his Ph.D. in Molecular Biology\!
