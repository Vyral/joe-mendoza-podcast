Welcome to another edition of the "Real Estate Raw Show." Today I have a very special guest, Darrin Brightmon. He’s a former star running back for UNLV, a colonel in the Army Reserves, and a fantastic general contractor with a great company, BDG Builders. I sat down with him to talk about the business, what he does, and how he helps people like myself and my clients on a daily basis. **Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the topics that interest you most:**

1:30- How Darrin got into the general contracting business.

3:00- The different licenses in the contracting world and the licenses that Darrin has himself.
