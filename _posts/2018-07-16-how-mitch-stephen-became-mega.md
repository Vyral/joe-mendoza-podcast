Mitch Stephen, mega-successful real estate investor, author, and podcast host, is on the phone with me today to discuss how he climbed to the heights he has achieved.

On today’s episode of “The Real Estate Raw Show,” I’m very excited to introduce our outstanding guest from Texas, Mitch Stephen. **Mitch has bought, owner-financed, and sold over 1,500 homes in his hometown since 1996** —not as an agent, but as an investor. He has his own podcast and has written several books, so I’m extremely happy to have him on to discuss how he’s become so successful.

**For your convenience, I’ve timestamped the interview below so that you can jump to whatever topics interest you most.**

0:40- Retaining one-third of the 1,500 homes Mitch has accumulated.
1:20- Mitch’s path to financial freedom
4:20- What are Mitch’s strengths?
5:20- Explaining owner-financing
8:50- Mitch’s idea of a perfect student
12:25- Mitch’s biggest success stories
15:50- Mitch’s parting advice

I want to thank Mitch so much for being on our show, and I hope he can come back again to explore some other questions about his success. If you would like to get more detailed information about his insight and experiences, visit the following links:
