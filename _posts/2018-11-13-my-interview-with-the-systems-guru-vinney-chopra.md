I first heard Vinney on a podcast in which he was talking about how he came to this country with only $7. From there, he accumulated property after property after property, and he now has a youth academy focused on 18-year-olds and is managing over $200 million-worth of multifamily units.

Today, I wanted to speak with Vinney and hear his story because it’s chock-full of value and wisdom. To learn his story, methods, and strategies, refer to the video above. I’ve the created timestamps below so that you can navigate the discussion at your leisure:
