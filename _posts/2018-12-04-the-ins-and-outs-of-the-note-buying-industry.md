I’ve known Scott for a few years, and he’s a stand-up guy doing great business. I’m so pleased to have him on “The Real Estate Raw Show” to talk about his career and his tactics.

**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps below so that you can navigate the conversation Scott and I had at your leisure:**

1:25—The sudden and drastic downturn of the market in 2008 that caused Scott to leave the mortgage industry to turn to buying distressed debt.

2:10—What exactly does it mean to buy notes?

5:30—What is the best time of year to buy notes, or is it year-round?

9:40—Scott’s words of caution to anyone out there teaching about note-buying

11:20—For those just getting started in the business, what is the hardest aspect of the job?

13:00—Different states have different foreclosure time frames, so are some states easier to work in than others?

14:15—Start-up fees and ongoing monthly fees for new arrivals to the field

17:00—A quick break in the discussion and a word from our sponsors

20:33—What kind of numbers are in play in the note-buying game?

25:00—What to say in tough situations involving tenants of the properties

28:30—The market is shifting; inventory is staying on longer and prices are coming down. What impact does that have in this business?

32:00—Scott’s preferences among asset class, storage, apartments, shopping centers, single-family homes.

34:25—Is negotiating with the banks difficult?

35:45—Is there a minimum buy-in?
