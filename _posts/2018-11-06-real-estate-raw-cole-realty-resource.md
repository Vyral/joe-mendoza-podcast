On the latest episode of “Real Estate Raw,” I had the pleasure of being joined by Tyler Steenken from Cole Realty Resource. I talk to a lot of people around the country who are in the real estate business and one of the biggest challenges they have is lead generation. They don’t know who to call. That’s where Tyler and Cole Realty Resource come in—by providing data and information to help small businesses, investors, and more. **Here’s an outline of our wide-ranging discussion, with timestamps to that you can skip ahead to the part(s) that interest you the most:**
