We’re back with part two of my exclusive interview with mega-successful real estate investor Mitch Stephen.

On today’s episode of “The Real Estate Raw Show,” I’m excited to conclude our interview with mega-successful real estate investor Mitch Stephen. As I said before, Mitch has bought, owner-financed, and sold over 1,500 homes in his hometown since 1996, and he has plenty more to say about how he was able to do this.

**For your convenience, I’ve timestamped the rest of the interview below so that you can jump to whatever topics interest you most:**

1:15 - The story of how Mitch wrote his first book.

7:27 - The inspiration behind his message.

9:14 - A CliffsNotes breakdown of all the books Mitch has published and what they can teach you.

15:28 - Books that have changed Mitch’s life and the lessons they taught him.

19:30 - His advice to anyone who thinks they’re stuck in a rut.

22:30 - How he works with sellers and what the benefits of owner financing are.

26:00 - How he automates his business.

29:30 - Why storage units are such a great investment.

Once again, I want to thank Mitch for being on my show, and I hope he can join us again someday to share more stories about how to achieve and maintain his level of success.
